This model of a Music shop structure demonstrates:
* **unit testing** as part of a TDD approach
* **composition** to realistically illustrate the type of association between accessory and instrument classes
* appropriate use of **packages** for organisation of code. 
* use of **interfaces** to abstract out behaviours and distinguish between accessory and instrument classes
* **abstract classes** to keep the code DRY 
* meaningfully named methods and variables to ensure **clean code**
* **method overriding** to reveal the polymorphic possibilities of the interface choice
